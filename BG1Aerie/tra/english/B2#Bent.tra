@0    = ~An elven girl asked us to help. Are you alright?~
@1    = ~You must mean Aerie. I fear she would have tried to fight Zordral herself... I had to be a bit hard on her to convince the child to get herself away to safety. I hope she understands. She's a good girl, but weighed down by a great sadness. She won't discuss it with myself, or even Quayle out of respect for all the kindness he's already shown her. But she grows more and more restless by the day... sometime soon, he'll have to let her go so she might find her own way...~
@2    = ~Oh, listen to me ramble. I must go and rest. Please, take this as thanks.~
